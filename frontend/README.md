This is a A full stack **Query Management Application** where users can create, update, and delete queries. Each query will have a title, description, date, and a status (OPEN, RESOLVED). Queries in the context of an EDC (electronic data capture) system help identify and flag incorrect data entries for patients and alert effected data managers/ users when a query needs to be resolved, and a management portal allow users to update and manage queries efficiently without losing progress on work or questions.
